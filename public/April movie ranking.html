<h1>April's Favorite People</h1>

<h2>My top three for my favorite out of everyone I met</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>My Babisko</h3>
<p>My dad is my favorite person. 
He is one of the two people who I know will accept me and love me no matter what.
Also him being the most amazing dad I know also helps</p>

<h3>My Mamisko</h3>
<p>My mom is my favorite person because I have huge respect for her to be able to raise such a difficult child such as 
myself should be the hardest job on the planet.  Also the fact that she hosted me for the first nine months of my life is an extremely great for me.
I wouldn't change both my parents for the world.</p>

<h3>My Annis Junior</h3>
<p>My sister deserves a raise to be able to grow up with me. I was extremely annoying to her.
But she was able to survive nevertheless. Additionally she has this weird mother instinct towards me which I secretly enjoy.
</p>

<h3>Mi amore</h3>
<p>I love mi amore more than anything and he is my favorite person in the whole world that isn't related to me.
He is the person who motivates me and made me believe in love.
